## CS 225 Final Project Team Contract

### Communication

**Team Meeting:** Our team will meet three times a week, on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM CT. These meetings will be conducted over Discord or in-person, depending on the circumstances. We will try to record each meeting to ensure any valuable information discussed during the meeting can be referenced later.

**Assistance:** We will create a Discord server to easily allow members to communicate with one another and have any concerns resolved as soon as possible. Members will be expected to answer within 24 hours, unless they have previously made clear that they will not be available for a period of time.

**Respect:** We commit to enforce showing respect among members of the team. If any members sees another member being disrespectful, we hold ourselves to be responsible to call out that disrespectful member and try to resolve that behavior as soon as possible.

### Collaboration

**Work Distribution:** We plan to have another meeting in a few days where we will discuss the distribution of work. We will also meet regularly after implementing each graph algorithm to ensure each member is aware of what they are responsible for.

**Time Commitment:** It is difficult to predict how long the project will take and make certain claims this early. Currently, we estimate each group member is to work at least 5 hours per week. All members of the team have agreed on the times we have set aside.

**Conflict Resolution:** We will encourage any members to immediately come forward with any disagreements they have regarding behavior or progression of the project. We will try to discuss these disagreements and try to come to appropriate compromises. Dismissing one person's opinion on the basis that the other three people are of another opinion is not justifiable. If one member does not complete his task on time or is habitually late, another member(s) of the group will reach out to ensure that there are no external factors limiting that member's ability to contribute to the project. In the case that something important limits that individual's ability to complete his tasks, the remainder of the members agree to split work appropriately in order to avoid delays on the project.
