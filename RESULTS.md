## CS 225 Final Project Recap

### Final Deliverables

Say two friends live very far apart -- possibly across a very large country or continent, or several continents apart. If these two friends wanted to meet, how would they decide where to fly? One could fly to the other, but one friend has to travel much further than the other. Alternatively, consider if they wanted to explore a new city together. How might they find the most convenient city, closest to both by flight? We will create an application that will determine the best airport for two friends to meet at, given their departure airports. The best airport will be the one where the travel distance for both friends is roughly equal and minimized.
